# github-practice
We try to break GitHub.

## Authors
- Dan Johnson
- Summer Mengarelli

## The Basics

In order to break GitHub, we first need some basic merge conflicts
- Such as two people editing the file at the same time
- Anything else?

## Branching

So, I've started adding new lines at 14 for the branch test. I (Dan) am now trying to create a conflict on this line.

## New git commands we're learned
- reflog
- cherry-pick
- checkout
- switch
